Developed a client-server application using Pythonâ€™s socket library to implement a multiplayer Hangman game. The first client provides a secret word and its definition, while the second client attempts to guess the word letter by letter. The server manages communication between clients, tracks game state, updates the Hangman drawing after incorrect guesses, and announces the result.
